Personal Website
================
All required components of this project have been completed. The three pages (index.html, bio.html, resume.html) were created with the appropriate names and content. This includes links to the other pages from index.html. The files were successfully hosted on github and a redirect page was successfully added to my Tufts CS account.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

I spent approximately 8 hours working on this assignment.
